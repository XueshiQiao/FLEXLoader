## FLEX loader Tweak
FLEX loader can dynamiclly load FLEX dynamic libarary (`FLEXDylib.dylib`) which was made from [FLEX](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX) by me, of course you can make yourself and replace it with yours(ref:[FLEXDynamicLibProject](https://github.com/qiaoxueshi/FLEXDynamicLibProject)).  Configuration is via the FLEXLoader menu in Settings.app.

This tweak is inspired by [RevealLoader](https://github.com/heardrwt/RevealLoader) and modified from RevealLoader. Reveal Loader dynamically loads libReveal.dylib (Reveal.app support) into iOS apps on jailbroken devices. 

## What is FLEX 
> FLEX (Flipboard Explorer) is a set of in-app debugging and exploration tools for iOS development. When presented, FLEX shows a toolbar that lives in a window above your application. From this toolbar, you can view and modify nearly every piece of state in your running application.
